## Introduction
The very creatively named URLShortener is a simple project that allows you to easily host your own URL shortening website! Feel free to edit this project in anyway, it's simply a one-page skeleton site that is meant to be edited. I only ask that you credit me and link to this GitHub project.

## Uses
- php
- libapache2-mod
- mysql (the php script is written with mysqli php driver)
- apache2 (feel free to use any web-server but the nice url formatting from the .htaccess file won't work and you'll have to change the way urls are created in the shortener.php file)
- Font Awesome
- Bootstrap
- Bootstrap Material Design by FezVrasta

## To-do list
- [X] Make the project public
- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Create stats page (with above logged info)
- [ ] Support other web-server software (eg; nginx)
- [ ] Make detailed set-up instructions
- [ ] Finish the document I was writing about how I created the project.
